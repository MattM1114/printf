this is a group project the authors of this project Chuene Ramashala and Matthew Magadza

Returns: the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings)
write output to stdout, the standard output stream
format is a character string. The format string is composed of zero or more directives. See man 3 printf for more detail. You need to handle the following conversion specifiers:
c
s
%


1. Education is when you read the fine print. Experience is what you get if you don't
Handle the following conversion specifiers: 
d
i
You don’t have to handle the flag characters
You don’t have to handle field width
You don’t have to handle precision
You don’t have to handle the length modifiers

2. With a face like mine, I do better in print
Handle the following custom conversion specifiers:

b: the unsigned int argument is converted to binary
alex@ubuntu:~/c/printf$ cat main.c
#include "main.h"

/**
 * main - Entry point
 *
 * Return: Always 0
 */
int main(void)
{
    _printf("%b\n", 98);
    return (0);
}
alex@ubuntu:~/c/printf$ gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic -std=gnu89 main.c
alex@ubuntu:~/c/printf$ ./a.out
